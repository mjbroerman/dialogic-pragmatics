# Dialogic Pragmatics (DP1)

## Description

A Python program that simulates **Dialogic Pragmatics Inquiry** games between agents, modeling dialogues based on a Material Semantic Frame (MSF). It allows users to customize agent inferential theories and strategies, providing insights into reasoning processes and argumentative structures in dialogues. This tool is useful for exploring concepts in pragmatics, logic, and semantics, and serves as a proof of concept for dialogic reasoning simulations.

## Original Author

All code is due to Ph.D. student **Yao Fan**, under the supervision of Professor Robert Brandom. I have only implemented small improvements and bugfixes. 

The program was presented in the course:

**Metavocabularies of Reason: Pragmatics, Logic, and Semantics**  
Philosophy 2420—Fall 2022—University of Pittsburgh  
Instructor: Professor Bob Brandom

Program version: **DP1**
